# Speedy pizza game

An online game I developed when I was in high school, now available on my GitHub profile!

Play online at: [speedy-pizza-enas.onrender.com](https://speedy-pizza-enas.onrender.com/)!

## Game lore
In the game, you play as a pizza delivery guy who must deliver pizzas to every house in town as quickly as possible on his motorbike.

## Development lore
A game designed to teach people how to use a mouse, inspired by the flash games I played as a child, with plenty of references and developed with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Future developments
I should update it to add a page with high scores and a global leaderboard.

## Misc
As you can see the drawing on the index page was made with A.I. sadly. But all other assets in the game have been hand made by my in MS Paint (and the motorbike guy is part of a free assets library by [TMD Studios](https://tmdstudios.wordpress.com/)).
